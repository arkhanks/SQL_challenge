I looked at the csv files to determine what I was looking at as far as column names and understanding the data in general.

I used quickDBD to sketch the realtionships between the tables and used chatGPT and Xpert Learning Assistant to help me determine some of the foreign keys relationships

I created the employees database in pgAdmin and created the tables using the relationships I had sketched in the ERM

I imported the csv files data into the tables I had created, making sure to do so in the correct order

I wrote the SQL queries to get the information asked for. I used Xpert Learning Assistant to help me with how to choose 1986 as the hire_date year in #2

In looking at the tables I had created I knew the format of the hire_date in the Employees table so I knew how to structure the dates for #2

I used Xpert Learning Assistant to help me with the last query.

I went back and ran queries to determine the maximun number of characters in the first and last names and the department names and titles to better assign VARCHAR numbers

I then adjusted all of the tables schemata and the ERM to update the VARCHAR and CHAR values
